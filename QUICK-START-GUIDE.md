‚úÖ **COMPLETED!** Your SharePoint list is ready!

### **Step 3: Import Subscription Flow (DETAILED WALKTHROUGH)**

**üéØ Goal:** Set up the automation that processes subscription form responses

#### **3A. Export Flow as ZIP File (3 minutes) - IMPORTANT**

**Note:** Power Automate requires a `.zip` package file for import, not a `.json` file.

**If you have an existing flow to export:**

1. Go to **<https://flow.microsoft.com>**
2. Sign in with your work account
3. Click **"My flows"** in the left sidebar
4. Find your flow and click the **"..."** (three dots) menu
5. Select **"Export"** ‚Üí **"Package (.zip)"**
6. Choose export settings:
   - Name: Keep default or rename
   - Click **"Export"** 
7. **Download** the `.zip` file to your computer

**If you don't have a flow to export:**

- The workspace should contain `SUBSCRIPTION-PROCESSING-FLOW.zip`
- If you only see `.json` files, you'll need to create the flow manually using the JSON as reference

#### **3B. Go to Power Automate (1 minute)**

1. Open **<https://flow.microsoft.com>** in a new tab
2. **Sign in** with your work account (same one you used for SharePoint)
3. You should see the Power Automate dashboard

#### **3C. Import the Flow (2 minutes)**

1. Click **"My flows"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Import"** at the top
3. Click **"Upload"** and select your `SUBSCRIPTION-PROCESSING-FLOW.zip` file
4. Click **"Import"** - you'll see a screen with connection requirements

#### **3D. Configure Connections (5 minutes) - CRITICAL STEP**

You'll see 3 connections that need to be set up:

**Connection 1: Microsoft Forms**

- Click **"Select during import"**
- Choose **"Create new"**
- Click **"Save"** (it will connect automatically)

**Connection 2: SharePoint**

- Click **"Select during import"**
- Choose **"Create new"**
- Click **"Save"** (it will connect to your SharePoint site)

**Connection 3: Office 365 Outlook**

- Click **"Select during import"**
- Choose **"Create new"**
- Click **"Save"** (connects your email for sending confirmations)

#### **3E. Update Form ID (2 minutes) - MUST DO**

1. After importing, click **"Edit"** on the imported flow
2. Look for the trigger: **"When a new response is submitted"**
3. You'll see `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_FORM_ID` - **this needs to be replaced**

**To get your Form ID:**

- From your form URL: `https://forms.office.com/e/Ncx0j1M6QR`
- Your Form ID is: **`Ncx0j1M6QR`**

1. Replace `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_FORM_ID` with `Ncx0j1M6QR`

#### **3F. Turn On the Flow (1 minute)**

1. Click **"Save"** at the top
2. Click **"Turn on"**
3. You should see "Flow is on" status
